# Calculator
trying to make a calculator

created a python environment called .venv on windows
-CREATE: python -m venv .venv

Activate and deactivate on windows
-ACTIVATE: .\.venv\Scripts\activate (may not be allowed, see below for instructions)
-DEACTIVATE: deactivate

Activate and deactivate on mac
-ACTIVATE: source .venv/bin/activate
-DEACTIVATE: deactivate

I had to allow usage in windows powershell (WINDOWS + X) and then run as admin
ALLOW ACTIVATION: Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned (then type "y")
DISALLOW ACTIVATION: Set-ExecutionPolicy Restricted (then type "y")
